# Plotly & Belly Button Biodiversity

## Purpose of Project
The goal for this project was to create a dashboard that test participants and researchers can access to view the collected belly button bacteria data. The webpage users will be able to select any test subject's number and see which bacterial species live in their naval. User can also view the top 10 bacterial species that were collected for that test subject and the number of times they wash their belly button each week.
